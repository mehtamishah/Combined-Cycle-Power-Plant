# Predicting net electrical energy output in a combined cycle power plant
Built a model to increase efficiency and costs in a power plant â€” by predicting net hourly electric energy output
Tested mupliple algorithms. Best performance was achieved on a random forest regressor model
Achieved prediction accuracy of R2 score = 0.96, Mean absolute error = 2.44 on the test set
