# Project Predicting Net Electrical Energy Output in a Combined Cycle Power Plant
Built a model to increase efficiency and costs in a power plant â€” by predicting net hourly electric energy output. <br>

Assumption: Improvement in prediction of electric energy output is linked to a desirable output such as energy savings, minimizing costs or maximizing revenue. In a real word scenario, assumptions would be backed by evidence, either research or precedence. <br>

Built multiple models, namely multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression, random forest regression and XGBoost regression. Code for all these algorithms can be found [here](https://github.com/mehtamishah/Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant). <br>

Best performance was achieved on a random forest regressor model. <br>
Achieved prediction accuracy of R2 score = 0.96, Mean absolute error = 2.44 on the test set <br>
