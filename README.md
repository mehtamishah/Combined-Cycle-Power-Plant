# Predicting net electrical energy output in a combined cycle power plant
Built a model to increase efficiency and costs in a power plant â€” by predicting net hourly electric energy output. <br>

Built multiple models, namely multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression, random forest regression and XGBoost regression.

Best performance was achieved on a random forest regressor model. <br>
Achieved prediction accuracy of R2 score = 0.96, Mean absolute error = 2.44 on the test set
